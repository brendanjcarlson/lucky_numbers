# Lucky Numbers
# Given a list of integers a_list, a lucky integer is an integer which has a frequency in the list equal to its value.
# Return a lucky integer in the list. If there are multiple lucky integers return the largest of them. If there is no lucky integer return -1.
# Example 1:
# Input: a_list = [2,2,3,4]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The only lucky number in the list is 2 because frequency[2] == 2.
# Example 2:
# Input: a_list = [1,2,2,3,3,3]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: 1, 2 and 3 are all lucky numbers, return the largest of them.
